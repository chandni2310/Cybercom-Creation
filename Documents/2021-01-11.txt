Started the day by watching videos given in the link
Learned about  :if-else statements
                          boolean logic--AND, OR and NOT operations
                          Ternary operator-it can be used same as if-else statements and also helps to reduce line of code
                          Switch statement
	         Truthy and falsy value--which helps us to know whether a variable is defined or not
                           Functions--function is used so that we don't need to write same code again and again. So basically function help us to reuse code.
                           Arrays

Then in meeting madam teached us about form, different attribute and different methods of form
Learned about name and id attribute in form.
It is best practice to use name and id in every tag and id needs to be unique so it is easy to fectch and dosen't create conflict.
