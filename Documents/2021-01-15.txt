Watched the videos given in the link:
Objects, inheritence in objects, prototype chain, primitive vs objects and function class

Learned how to create instance from constructor so that we don't need to create object for each one
Then learned how we can inherit using prototype function.
Show various properties of Object such as:
			toString()
			hasownProperty()
			valueof()
			is prototypeof()
Difference between objects and primitive data types:
-->primitive data contains actual value while object contains reference(i.e memory address)

Object.create()-->it is another way to create object
	           it creates an object that  directly inherits  the argument passed 
Then in meeting madam explained about how to check whether object or object property is null or not.
