Arrow function:Basically arrow function is usd to write function in easy way, less line of code compared to traditional functions
In arrow function we can access current index,current element and array itself.
Arrow function don't have their own 'this' keyword. They use 'this' keyword of function they are written in. Hence, they have 'lexical this' keyword

Array in ES6:
various methods are introduced in ES6 for arrays.
Array.from(), find(),findIndex()
Array.from()-->it converts objects and iterable values into array structure.

Learned about map() function
it creates a new array as per provided condition. it dosen't change original value, it creates copy of resultant array

Destructing
Destructing is used to return different value of array or objects.
for e.g. const obj={
	name2:'Josh',
	lastName:'Twain'
};
const{name2,lastName}=obj;  //It will create different independent values for name2 and lastName

In meeting learned about objects and how to access methods.
Difference between simple for and for-in loop:-->simple for loop is not sync while for-in loop is async
