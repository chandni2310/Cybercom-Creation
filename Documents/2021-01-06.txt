Started with  practising previous day's commands
learned we can add all file using -A flag--git add -A
Explored and learned about rebase: It is also kind of merging
                                   It is used to make linaer sequence of commits.
                                   Benefit of using rebase is that it gives much cleaner project history.
  
Watched tutorial about git on youtube--where it explained about git work flow
