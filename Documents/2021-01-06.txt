Started with  practising previous day's commands
learned we can add all file using -A flag--git add -A
Explored and learned about rebase: It is also kind of merging
                                   It is used to make linaer sequence of commits.
                                   Benefit of using rebase is that it gives much cleaner project history
                                   
Learned difference between git merge and git rebase--Compared to merge, rebase dosen't create any extra commits.
While implementing rebase command got error can't peform rebase, after seaching on google I got the solution.
Watched tutorial about git on youtube--where it explained about git work flow.
Performed revert command to go back to last commit as told by sir--git revert -m 1 [commit code]5b6b61a5e93fe317d7e2d07473d12dbc52c67338

Then experimented with different commands to check log: 
                                                        git log --graph-->It displays all commits in form of graph,tree like structure
                                                        git log --after="20121-01-04"-->to filter log after specific date
                                                        git log author="Chandni2310"--> to check log done by particular user/author
                                                        
Learned about reset command: to move location of head to specified commit
                                                        git reset --hard HEAD-->to go back to HEAD
                                                        git reset --hard HEAD^ --> to go back to commit before HEAD
At last done merge-commit of two different branches and then check the loacation of head if it is same or not after merge and commit as discussed in the meeting.
