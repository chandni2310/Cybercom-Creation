Started with pracitising previous day's command and commands given in the document
Created branch from a branch. While doing it I got error that failed to push and rejected while pushing main branch
Then after searching I came to know first of all we need to fetch and then pull our repository after that push the newly created branch

Tags:
studied about tags in git
tags are used to refer to specific points in history for our repository or data
basically tags are done to mark release points
To create tag
		git tag v1.0
To create tag with message
		git tag -a v1.1 -m "tag for v1.1 release"
To check tags
		git tag -->it will list all the tags created
To get all details of tag
		git show v1.0
		git tag -l "v1.*"-->It will display all tags starting with v1

Then in meeting sir explained about difference between --no-ff and fast forward in merge. Main difference is Fast forward merge will collect all files at one place and then it will perform merge.

Submodules:
Learned about submodules in git, when it is used as explained by sir-->Git submodule is basically a record within a git repository that points to specific commits in another external repository.

Also learned about types of reset.There are 3 form of reset:Hard
					      Soft
				                        Mixed
At last experimented with git squash command:it is used to keep history clean.
				     it is used to compact all commits into one request
